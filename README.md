# Drake
## The name
This is a web interface for Ugly Duckling, Detectifys module test application.  
I wanted a name that was a synonym with duck and found "Drake".  
I then realized that Drake Mallard (the alter-ego of Darkwing Duck) is actually called Drake for that reason =D.
It just happens to be so that "Drake" also means dragon in swedish so the name was perfect.


## What is it?
A web interface for Ugly Duckling.
My wife started her new role as the Community manager for Detectify.
To understand more of what she was doing (since I don't have a background in cyber security) I decided to learn more by writing some code.
Detectify launched a new tool called Ugly Ducking where ethical hackers can build and test their modules befor submitting them.
The format is a JSON format thad describes the request and what to test in the response to identify a possible threat.
To make this run I would have to install go and learn how that works (which is something I wasn't to keen to do).
So I though would it be possible to make a Blazor implementation of this?
What would be the best way to edit a JSON file?

Since Microsoft have released a version of Monaco (the engine VSCode is running) I wanted to gove that a try.
